### No More Meta Scaling

The mod removes means to infinitely gain Power, money, MaxHp, Hp etc. during the combat. 

It applies sweeping ban to actions generating corresponding meta-resources. If the source of action is a card copied, created or bounced form exile **by another card**, the meta resource action will not resolve. 

I.e., *Lucky Break* created by *Trace On* won't give money but will still give Amulet. If *Lucky Break* was somehow generated by an exhibit or ultimate it would resolve fully.

Since ban is sweeping the mod will very likely work on modded cards as well, provided they follow at least somewhat sane conventions.


Also removes P drops from second wave onwards of Clownpiece summons.

*note:*  the mod is a bit raw and has chance of breaking something.

*2do:* make ruling more clear with stacking SE applied by cards (Mokou Ability).

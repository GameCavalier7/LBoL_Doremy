### No More Meta Scaling

The mod removes means to infinitely gain Power, money, MaxHp, Hp etc. during the combat. 

It applies sweeping ban to specific actions generating corresponding meta-resources. The ban is card-centric and propagating from the most problematic of cards - the cards added in combat.

### Ruleset
```
Banned Card: a card which cancels actions providing meta resources which originate from it.
  -I.e., a banned Lucky Break wouldn't give money but would still give Amulet.

Card played becomes banned unless it's a Teammate being summoned.
  -This is to prevent infinite Exile bounces 
   or Copy sources without Exile or safety clauses.

Card generated by another Card is considered banned.
  -Status Effects added by cards (i.e. Abilities) are considered as a Card for the rule above.
    -Meaning copies by Fake Moon would always be banned as Fake Moon is always banned itself.
  -Status Effects added by cards has the same ban state as the card adding it.
    -SEs which provide meta resources are split into different stacks according to their legality.
      -In vanilla, that's only Immortal Flame and Sweet Sweet Potato.
  -Cards generated by natural Echo effect are exempt.
    -Cards which gain Echo obey Copy rules.
  -Copies are considered generated cards and thus banned
   unless BanLevel option is `RealCopiesAllowed` (default).
     -With the option, Copies are legal unless copy target and/or copy source is banned.
     -I.e., copies Lucky Break from the deck copied by LiP which is also from the deck
      would provide money.
```

**Additionally**, the mod removes P, money and point drops after certain number of enemies have been summoned.
`For Rin it's 21, 9 for Kokoro and 3 for Clownpiece`


Since ban is made to be generic the mod will very likely work on modded cards as well, provided they follow at least somewhat sane conventions. 
There's an API in the works for modders to add inclusions/exceptions to bannable entities.
It's defined in [`NoMetaScalinAPI`](https://github.com/Neoshrimp/LBoL_Doremy/blob/master/NoMetaScaling/Core/API/NoMetaScalinAPI.cs) and meant to be used as a conditional dependency [similar to Watermark](https://github.com/Neoshrimp/LBoL_Doremy/blob/master/NoMetaScaling/APIusageAsConditionalDependency.txt).
